        <h2>Our Past</h2>
        <p>
            NRG was founded in November 2015 by Sacramento Kings co-owners Mark Mastrov and Andy Miller. Both co-owners had a vision to build a top-tier esports organization. Initially focused on games like Overwatch and Rocket League, NRG quickly established itself as a dominant force in the competitive gaming scene. Our early years were filled with challenges, but our determination and passion for esports propelled us to new heights.
